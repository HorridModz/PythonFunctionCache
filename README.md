This repository is a comparison of ways to cache functions in python. I came up with 4 ways to cache function results, then wrote the pros and cons for each method. I also created a speedtest to compare all the methods, as well as an example without caching.

For the example function, I used a simple recursive algorithm that calculates the factorial of a number.
